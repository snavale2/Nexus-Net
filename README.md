### **Key Features**
1. **[RFC 2813](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2813) Compliance**
   - Implements mandatory server-to-server communication features, including message propagation, user state management, and channel synchronization.

2. **Optimized Performance**
   - Written in C for low-level control and efficient resource utilization.
   - Supports high-concurrency connections.

3. **Advanced Error Handling**
   - Includes mechanisms to prevent and recover from netsplits.
   - Implements logging for debugging and audit purposes.

4. **Secure Connections**
   - Enforces TLS encryption for secure communication between servers.
   - Provides options for user authentication and IP whitelisting.

5. **Extensibility**
   - Modular design allows easy addition of features such as multimedia support, custom channel modes, and analytics.

---

### **Technical Overview**
1. **Core Components**
   - **Main Loop**: Event-driven architecture using `select()`/`epoll()` for handling multiple connections.
   - **Message Parser**: Processes IRC commands and routes messages efficiently.
   - **Channel Manager**: Handles creation, deletion, and moderation of channels.
   - **User Session Manager**: Tracks user connections and state.

2. **Server Linking**
   - Implements tree-based server connections as per [RFC 2813](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2813).
   - Includes fault-tolerant mechanisms for link stability.

3. **Protocol Extensions**
   - Support for Direct Client-to-Client (DCC) operations, such as file transfers.
   - Enhanced logging and monitoring for server administrators.

---

### **Build and Installation**

1. **Prerequisites**
   - GCC or Clang compiler.
   - OpenSSL library for TLS support.


2. **Build the Server**
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. **Run the Server**
   ```bash
   ./nexusnet --config config.cfg
   ```

---

### **Configuration**
1. **Edit Configuration File**
   - Modify `config.cfg` to specify server settings such as ports, encryption keys, and server links.

2. **Starting NexusNet**
   - Run the server using the configuration file:
     ```bash
     ./nexusnet --config config.cfg
     ```

3. **Client Connection**
   - Use any IRC client to connect to NexusNet:
     ```bash
     /server your-server-address 6667
     ```

### **Acknowledgments**
NexusNet is inspired by [RFC 2813](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2813) and benefits from the contributions of the global IRC community. Special thanks to developers and testers who helped refine this implementation.
